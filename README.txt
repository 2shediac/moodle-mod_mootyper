This is the README file for the MooTyper project. MooTyper is a moodle extension, 
that simulates the 'typing instructor' programs. MooTyper is a free software just
like Moodle.

1. REQUIREMENTS

Plugin uses javascript which is not welcome in Moodle but it is a requirement for 
the use of the plugin. It creates some new tables in a moodle database and inserts a 
quite some sample typing exercises. This is all done automaticaly through the intstallation.

2. INSTALLATION

MooTyper is an activity module. You have to extract it to the 'mod' directory. Than
go to Site Administration -> Notifications and click on the button below.

3. USE

Using MooTyper plugin is very simple. An instance can be added as new activity in a
course just like Lesson or Quiz. This video shows how to add exercise, create an instance
and than view grades: [Video was removed due to further development of the plugin].

Good luck!
